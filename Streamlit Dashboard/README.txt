Summary
Sales data for vending machine sales and is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awesomeasingh/vending-machine-sales?resource=download
I chose Streamlit for this project because can be done exclusively in Python and showcases a combination of familiarity with Python and data processing.
It is presented in a dashboard layout as an example of a front-end tool that others might use. The Dashboard has ranking information to compare locations against each other and shows monthly sales trends.
