Intro:
This folder is a collection of my college work that is not programming related, but instead demonstrates my ability to write and communicate information. 
These skills are understandably important for any profession, and very much so for data.

As a biochem graduatuate, only a few classes actually requested written projects as assignments. 
I know the topics seem a little niche at first glance, but I think they are well-written and organized in a way that is easy to follow along.

~~ You may get to learn something neat while also looking into my previous work! ~~
 
Contents:
- Genetics Journals: 
	- These are personal notes that I used to do my presentations on. The assignment was to research scientific journals on a particular topic and summarize their contents as a presentation. 
	- There is a lot of data, statistics and chart-reading involved for these papers, which is the basics of these journals being peer-reviewed.  

- Nutrition book evalution:
	- This is basically a book report as a reader informed on the topic would do. There is a focus on whether the dietary information of the book should be recommended to the average person.
	- Here my assignment is to come to my own conclusion based on the information in the book, and assess how it matches up with the domain of agreed nutrition science.  
	- Please note this report is rather lengthy! Consider first reading the Genetics Journals.
